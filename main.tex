\runsubsection{Speech and Speaker Recognition}
\descript{| college level project}
\location{November,2018 | Bangalore}
\textbullet{} Trained a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) for recordings of students.\\
\textbullet{} Made a Voice Attendance System to show proof of concept, we also took \\additional measures so that students don't play voice recording to give proxy.\\
\textbullet{} Basically converted .wav files to a spectogram , and calculated MFCC coefficients,\\ which was then fed into a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).\\
\textbullet{} This created a separate model for each student. Attendance was given for each day and stored in a database, which could further be reviewed by the faculty.



\runsubsection{CCN Decentralized cloud}
